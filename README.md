## Manufacturer Logos
Only top 50 included given discord limitations of 50 emojis per server (bots get to use server emotes anywhere, but I didn't feel like making > 1 server for this)

  
## Start Here  
this is a note to self... obviously, you'd need the token to run the bot, and the 'Secrets' folder that is referenced in some files.
``` bash
python -m venv venv  
.\venv\Scripts\activate.bat  
pip install -r requirements.txt

git clone https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py  
python -m pip install -U discord.py/.[voice]
rmdir /S discord.py 
```
